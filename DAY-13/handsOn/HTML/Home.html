            Majapahit Empire, the last Indianzed Kingdom in Indonesia, based in
            eastern Java and existing between the 13th and 16th centuries. The
            founder of the empire was Vijaya, a prince of Singhasari who escaped
            when Jayakatwang, the ruler of Ka·∏çiri, seized the palace. In 1292
            Mongol
            troops came to Java to avenge an insult to the emperor of China,
            Kublai
            Khan, by Kertanagara, the king of Singhasari, who had been replaced
            by
            Jayakatwang. Vijaya collaborated with Mongol troops in defeating
            Jayakatwang. Vijaya then turned against the Mongols and expelled
            them
            from Java.

            Under his rule the new kingdom, Majapahit, successfully controlled
            Bali,
            Madura, Malayu, and Tanjungpura. The power of Majapahit reached its
            height in the mid-14th century under the leadership of King Hayam
            Wuruk
            and his prime minister, Gajah Mada. Some scholars have argued that
            the
            territories of Majapahit covered present-day Indonesia and part of
            Malaysia, but others maintain that its territory was confined to
            eastern
            Java and Bali. Nonetheless, Majapahit became a significant power in
            the
            region, maintaining regular relations with China, Champa, Cambodia,
            Annam, and Siam.

            The golden era of Majapahit was short-lived. The empire began to
            decline
            after the death of Gajah Mada in 1364, and it was further weakened
            after
            the death of Hayam Wuruk in 1389. The spread of Islam and the rise
            of
            the Islamic states along the northern coast of Java eventually
            brought
            the Majapahit era to an end in the late 15th or early 16th century.
